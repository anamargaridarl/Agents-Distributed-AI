# Distributed Agents and Artificial Intelligence

A two-part project implementing a distributed and decentralized system using the multi-agent systems paradigm applied to a drone access points' network. In the second part, agent-based simulations were explored with a simple API for JADE-based simulations allowing to scale the environment and study its performance
